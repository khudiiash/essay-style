**Included Issues:**

- Passive voice.
- Citation formatting (APA).
- Weak words.
- Wordiness.
- Concluding sentences.
- Repetitions.
- Phrasal verbs.
- Vague expressions.

**Modes:**

1. **Editing**
  This mode suits for writing from scratch or editing the essay. It highlights issues in real time and provides suggestions. However, it has its limitations: with a large amount of text, performance might suffer.
2. **Checking**
  This mode disables editing and highlights all the mistakes for a single purpose: export the text with highlights to another text editor. I made this mode mostly for my own purposes.
