&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Epidemiological Studies**

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For long periods, epidemiological studies have been utilized to impact interventions by helping in identifying, and reducing risk factors. Using epidemiological studies has helped change the way things are done. The health of a certain population of individuals is dependent on different factors. By using epidemiology, researchers play an important role by helping in describing the health status of individuals, and identifying and analyzing the risk factors associated with the health of a certain population. This way researchers establish the relationship between health and different hazardous agents. The paper discusses epidemiological studies related to population health.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important point of notice is that; epidemiological studies have never proven causation, meaning risk factors cannot be directly associated as the cause of a disease. However gathered evidence from epidemiological studies establishes the risk factors that can be correlated with the higher incidences of a certain disease within a certain population (Gulis and Fujino, 2019). This population must be exposed to the risk factor in question. A common example is the association of smoking cigarettes with lung cancer. Studies have shown that the risk of lung cancer contractions for smoker is bigger compared to non-smokers (Gulis & Fujino, 2004). This does not prove that lung cancer is caused by cigarette smoking; however, it basically establishes a link between the smoking of cigarettes, and the contraction of lung cancer. In my personal opinion, you have to attentively read about this therefore be aware of the situation. In general, the gathered evidence from epidemiological studies establishes the risk factors that can be correlated with the higher incidences of a certain disease within a certain population (Gulis & Fujino, 2015).
  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is safe to deduce that; through epidemiological studies, and the determination of risk factors associated with certain diseases, evidence-based practice can be improved. Evidence-based medicine utilizes a system of turning clinical into questions that need systematic solving (Gulis & Fujino, 2019). It is worth mentioning that that by implementing epidemiological studies into evidence-based practices, risk factors associated with certain diseases can be used to promote the health of individuals. This is done by advising individuals against risk factors of certain diseases when using evidence-based methods.
